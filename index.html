        ## Introduction
        Hello everyone. I am a junior working on obtaining my BS in Computer Science. I am an international student
        here at
        Northwest, I am originally a Nigerian. My hobbies include reading, gaming, cooking (yep, I’m an amazing cook),
        listening and singing to music and Traveling (I plan to take 2 years away from work and just TRAVEL THE GLOBE)
        . I
        always wanted to be a medical doctor but I hated the sight of blood, especially having to dissect animals. That
        wasn’t fun. So I decided to challenge myself and do something else and hence Computer Science.
        My career plan is to one day have a tech company that will change the landscape of technology, how I will get
        there
        I do not know but I will surely get there. For the immediate goal, I want to graduate year, find a job and work
        towards achieving my goal. I have a preference to work in a social media company or any user interactive
        company.
